# iCarousel.iOS.Binding
A net8 compatible implementation of the legacy Xamarin.iOS iCarousel binding library.

See:

https://github.com/jzeferino/Xamarin.iOS.iCarousel
https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinComponents/tree/main/iOS/iCarousel

To include into your net8 iOS app, run the `build.sh` from terminal, move the lib folders contents somewhere alongside your project and then directly reference the `Xamarin.iOS.iCarousel.Binding.dll` in your apps .csproj.

**Important**

This is a minimalistic implemention of the legacy Xamarin.iOS library; if you would like it to be 'nugetised', please reach out via matthew@mfractor.com or complete the work and submit it as a PR.
